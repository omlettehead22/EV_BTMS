# Changelog

## 0.2.0
- Electro-thermal load: Q = I²R(SOC,T) − I·T·dU/dT, coulomb-counted SOC, SOC windows.
- Cell library: LG M50 (21700) and LG MJ1 (18650) with cited parameters; jelly-roll cp and k from O'Regan 2022 layer data.
- Current profiles: constant C-rate, piecewise segments (optionally repeating), CSV import.
- Datasheet limit warnings (`check_limits`).
- Solver: Newton on the enthalpy residual is now the default (`SolverSettings.scheme="enthalpy"`). It converges on every step, about 3× faster, with machine-precision energy balance. The thesis scheme is still available and parity-tested.
- CLI subcommands: `btms thesis`, `btms cells`, `btms cell`.
- `metrics.summarise_result` works for any run, not just thesis scenarios.

## 0.1.0
- Python port of the MATLAB thesis model with bit-for-bit parity tests, README and CI.
